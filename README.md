# Employment-clicker
A game by Eskai Garcia

## What is this?
This is a small incremental style game created with React.

Employment-clicker started as a small class assignment geared towards teaching us about the usage of useReducer. The objective was to replicate just the first three upgrade options from the original 'Cookie clicker', but with some creative freedom and a weekend to myself, I decided to challenge myself and do something more than what had been planned.

## What features does it have?
Your objective in employment-clicker is to get a job in as little time as possible, for that you will need to upgrade tyour resume, portfolio and social presence.

 - Several upgrade paths to increase your clicks
 - Support for translations (currently supporting English and working on Spanish)

## What other features are there planned?
 - Random events with rewards
 - A prestige system with an additional upgrade path
 - Timer tracking to track the speed at which you progress 
 - Achievements to guide your progress through the game
 - The option to switch the appearance of the game
